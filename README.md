# AAC-coder
Implementation of an AAC Coder in Matlab. It consists of:

-A filterbank Level

-A Temporal Noise Shaping Level

-Quantization Level based on Psychoacoustic Model

-Î‘ Huffman encoding Level

As well as all inverse Levels for decoding

The Demo function DemoAAC3.m is a testing function. Using the LicorDeCalandraca.wav test wav file we can get the coded/decoded output file LicorLevel3.wav, while checking the SNR of the encoded file, the compression rate and the bitrate
